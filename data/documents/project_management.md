# Project Management Best Practices

## Planning Phase

### Define Clear Objectives
Every project should start with SMART goals:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined outcomes
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business goals
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadlines

### Stakeholder Analysis
Identify all stakeholders early:
1. Primary stakeholders (directly affected)
2. Secondary stakeholders (indirectly affected)
3. Key decision makers
4. Subject matter experts

## Execution Phase

### Task Breakdown
Use Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
- Level 1: Major deliverables
- Level 2: Sub-deliverables
- Level 3: Work packages
- Level 4: Individual tasks

### Resource Allocation
Match tasks to team capabilities:
- Consider skill sets and availability
- Account for learning curves
- Build in buffer time (15-20%)

## Monitoring and Control

### Key Metrics
Track these regularly:
- Schedule variance (SV)
- Cost variance (CV)
- Scope changes
- Risk status

### Communication
Weekly status updates should include:
- Accomplishments this week
- Plans for next week
- Blockers and risks
- Resource needs

## Lessons Learned

Document after each project:
- What went well
- What could improve
- Recommendations for future projects
